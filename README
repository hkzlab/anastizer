ANASTIZER

Tool to interactively warp a photo of a book page and make an 
anastatic-like b/w version out of it. Useful to speed up a book
digitalization process if you can't use a scanner.

This software uses OpenCV - http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/
The use of this software is FREE for non-commercial purposes,
otherwise an agreement needs to be reached with the developer (me).

Yes, this readme sucks, it's just a placeholder for now.
